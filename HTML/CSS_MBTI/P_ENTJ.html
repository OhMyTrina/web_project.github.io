                <p>ENTJ (Commander) is a personality type with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging traits.
                    They are decisive people who love momentum and accomplishment. They gather information to construct
                    their creative visions but rarely hesitate for long before acting on them.</p>
                <p>People with the ENTJ personality type (Commanders) are natural-born leaders. Embodying the gifts of
                    charisma and confidence, ENTJs project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common
                    goal. However, these personalities are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality,
                    using their drive, determination, and sharp mind to achieve whatever objectives they’ve set for
                    themselves. Their intensity might sometimes rub people the wrong way, but ultimately, ENTJs take
                    pride
                    in both their work ethic and their impressive level of self-discipline.</p>

            <h1>Strengths & Weaknesses</h1>
            <div class="good">
                <h2>Strengths</h2><br>
                <h3>Efficient</h3>
                <p>People with the ENTJ personality type (Commanders) see inefficiency not just as a problem
                    in
                    its own right but as something that pulls time and energy away from all their future goals, an
                    elaborate
                    sabotage consisting of irrationality and laziness. They will root out such behavior wherever they
                    go.</p>
                <h3>Energetic</h3>
                <p>ENTJ personalities approach their responsibilities with vigor and drive. This is
                    not
                    a type
                    to shy away from busy schedules or complex challenges. In fact, the more they are able to accomplish
                    throughout the day, the more energized they feel, and they will happily share this infectious
                    enthusiasm
                    for productivity with the people around them.</p>
                <h3>Self-Confident</h3>
                <p>ENTJs generally make their opinions known, trust in their abilities to get
                    things done,
                    and believe in their capacities as leaders. They are the most likely personality type to say they
                    feel
                    confident facing life’s day-to-day challenges.</p>
                <h3>Strong-Willed</h3>
                <p>eople with the ENTJ personality type don’t give up when the going gets
                    tough.
                    Instead,
                    they relentlessly strive to achieve their goals. Nothing is quite as satisfying to them as
                    accomplishing
                    something that they’ve set their mind to.</p>
                <h3>Strategic Thinkers</h3>
                <p>ENTJ personalities exemplify the difference between moment-to-moment
                    crisis
                    management and navigating the challenges and steps of a bigger plan. They are known for examining
                    every
                    angle of a problem and not just resolving momentary issues but moving the whole project forward with
                    their solutions.</p>
                <h3>Charismatic and Inspiring</h3>
                <p>All of the strengths listed above combine to create individuals
                    who
                    are able
                    to inspire and invigorate others, and this in turn helps ENTJs to accomplish their most ambitious
                    goals,
                    which could never be finished alone.

                <h2>Weaknesses</h2><br>
                <h3>Stubborn and Dominant</h3>
                <p>Sometimes all this confidence and willpower can go too far. ENTJ personalities are all too capable of
                    digging in their heels, trying to win every single debate, and only pushing for their vision without
                    considering the input of others.</p>
                <h3>Intolerant</h3>
                <p>“It’s my way or the highway” – People with the ENTJ personality type are notoriously unsupportive of
                    ideas that distract from their primary goals and even more so of ideas based on emotional
                    considerations. They won’t hesitate to make that fact clear to those around them.</p>
                <h3>Impatient</h3>
                <p>Some people need more time to think than others – an intolerable delay to quick-thinking ENTJ
                    personalities. They may misinterpret contemplation as stupidity or disinterest in their haste – a
                    terrible mistake to make.</p>
                <h3>Arrogant</h3>
                <p>ENTJs respect quick thoughts and firm convictions and may look down on those who don’t match up. This
                    is a challenge for most other personality types, who are perhaps not timid in their own right but
                    will seem so beside this sometimes overbearing type.</p>
                <h3>Poor Handling of Emotions</h3>
                <p>t times, ENTJ personalities can be distant from their own emotional expression and sometimes
                    downright scornful of others’. People with this personality type often trample others’ feelings,
                    inadvertently hurting their partners and friends, especially in emotionally charged situations.</p>
                <h3>Cold and Ruthless</h3>
                <p>Their obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the merits of rationalism, especially
                    professionally, make ENTJs fairly insensitive in pursuing their goals, dismissing personal
                    circumstances, sensitivities, and preferences as irrational or irrelevant.</p>
